# Datamon
Datamon is a platform that enables ordinary people make money from their own data.

# ToDos

- [] Add `RefreshControl` for project cards page. When the user drags the top of the scrollable content area downward, the scroll view reveals the refresh control, begins animating its progress indicator, and notifies your app. You use that notification to update your content and dismiss the refresh control. This is to update the list of projects that the user could join. So, when `RefreshControl` is triggered, we make a call to the firestore and get the latest project cards data.

# Notes:

- For adding custom fonts (e.g. Nunito), refer to [here](https://github.com/expo/google-fonts/tree/master/font-packages/nunito#readme)
